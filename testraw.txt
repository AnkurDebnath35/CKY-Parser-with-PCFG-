Junk-bond markdowns , an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation , a Drexel Burnham Lambert connection , a fizzled buy-out rumor . 
All this has cast a pall over Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its high-rolling 43-year-old chairman , Thomas Spiegel , who *T*-1 built the $ 12.7 billion *U* Beverly Hills , Calif. , thrift with high-yield junk bonds . 
Bears have targeted Columbia 's stock because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk market . 
And some investors fault Mr. Spiegel 's life style ; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia 's jet planes . 
Columbia stock recently hit 4 1\/8 , after * reaching 11 3\/4 earlier this year on rumors that Mr. Spiegel would take the thrift private . 
Moreover , junk professionals think Columbia 's huge third-quarter markdown of its junk portfolio to $ 4.4 billion *U* was n't enough , * meaning 0 another markdown could be coming . 
But in recent days , Columbia has edged up , *-1 closing at 5 1\/4 , up 3\/8 , yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure . 
Mr. Spiegel 's fans say 0 Columbia 's Southern California branches are highly salable , and the thrift has $ 458 million *U* of shareholders equity underlying its assets . 
That 's almost $ 10 *U* of equity for each Columbia share , including convertible preferred shares , though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion . 
Columbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands . 
The Spiegel family has 25 % of the common and 75 % of the votes . 
Other big common holders are Carl Lindner 's American Financial , investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research , though the latter cut its stake this summer . 
While many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia , investors say 0 Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan 0 * to mitigate Columbia 's junk problems *T*-1 . 
Indeed , Columbia executives recently told reporters 0 they were interested in * creating a separate unit 0 *T*-1 to hold Columbia 's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking . 
Columbia wo n't comment on all the speculation . 
But like other thrifts , it 's expected *-1 to seek regulators ' consent * to create a distinct junk-bond entity . 
Plans * to do this are due * to be filed *-1 in a week or so . 
New rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value , then sell the bonds over five years . 
That 's why Columbia just wrote off $ 130 million *U* of its junk and reserved $ 227 million *U* for future junk losses *T*-1 . 
But if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature -- at full value , unless the issuer goes bust or restructures -- the junk portfolio might do all right . 
Columbia , a longtime Drexel client , wo n't provide current data on its junk . 
But its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that *T*-1 have been really battered *-2 . 
These were Allied Stores , Western Union Telegraph , Gillett Holdings , SCI Television and Texas Air , though many other bonds in Columbia 's portfolio also have lost value . 
* Possibly offsetting that , Columbia recently estimated 0 it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million *U* . 
It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ 300 million *U* on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings . 
One trial balloon 0 Mr. Spiegel is said *-4 to have floated *T*-3 to investors : Columbia might be broken up *-1 , as Mellon Bank was split *-2 into a good bank and a bad bank . 
But Columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift , while the bad bank would be a private investment company , holding some of Columbia 's junk bonds , real estate and equity investments . 
Some think 0 Columbia 's thrift , which *T*-1 now is seeking a new chief operating officer , might be capitalized *-3 at , say $ 300 million *U* , and shopped *-3 to a commercial bank that *T*-2 wants a California presence . 
The thrift surely could be sold *-1 for more than the value of its equity , financial industry executives say 0 *T*-2 . 
Meanwhile , the bad bank with the junk bonds -- and some capital -- might be spun off *-1 to Columbia shareholders , including Mr. Spiegel , who *T*-2 might then have a new career , investors say 0 *T*-3 . 
It *EXP*-1 is n't clear how much a restructuring would help Columbia stockholders *T*-2 . 
But `` the concept is workable . 
You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds *-1 to capitalize the bad bank , '' says *T*-2 thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York . 
Mr. Spiegel 's next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street . 
Few people think 0 Mr. Spiegel wants *-1 to run a bread-and-butter thrift , which current rules would force Columbia to become *T*-2 . 
`` They are n't really a thrift , '' says *T*-1 Jonathan Gray , a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst . 
Of course , regulators would have *-1 to approve Columbia 's reorganization . 
And some investment bankers say 0 a restructuring is n't feasible while the SEC still is scrutinizing Mr. Spiegel 's past junk-bond trades .

Genetics Institute Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , said 0 it was awarded *-4 U.S. patents for Interleukin-3 and bone morphogenetic protein . 
The patent for Interleukin-3 covers materials and methods used * * to make the human blood cell growth factor via recombinant DNA technology . 
Sandoz Ltd. has licensed certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin-3 from Genetics Institute and is conducting preclinical studies with it . 
Interleukin-3 may help in * treating blood cell deficiencies associated * with cancer treatment , bone marrow transplants and other blood-cell disorders , Genetics Institute said 0 *T*-1 . 
The second patent describes bone morphogenetic protein-1 , a substance that *T*-2 can induce formation of new cartilage . 
The patent covers BMP-1 type proteins and pharmaceutical compositions and methods for * treating bone or cartilage defects , Genetics Institute said 0 *T*-1 . 
The company added that it has filed patent applications `` on a large number of different BMP proteins '' and the patent on BMP-1 is the first 0 it has received *T*-1 . 
BMP products may be useful in fracture healing and in * treating bone loss associated * with periodontal disease and certain cancers , the company said 0 *T*-1 .
The Bush administration 's nomination of Clarence Thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the American Bar Association gave Mr. Thomas only a `` qualified '' rating , rather than `` well qualified *T*-1 . '' 
People familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee , which *T*-1 will vote on the nomination , said 0 some liberal members of the panel are likely *-2 to question the ABA rating in hearings on the matter . 
Mr. Thomas , currently chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court . 
Groups have accused him of * advocating policies that *T*-1 narrowed rights of older workers and of * ignoring discrimination by large companies . 
Fourteen members of the House with jurisdiction over the EEOC have said 0 they oppose Mr. Thomas 's nomination because of `` serious questions about his judgment -LCB- and -RCB- respect for the law . '' 
A senior Justice Department official , however , said 0 the administration is n't worried about the ABA rating . 
`` We 're pleased 0 the ABA rated him qualified , '' David Runkel , the department 's chief spokesman , said *T*-1 in an interview . 
The ABA gives a `` qualified '' rating to nominees 0 it believes 0 *T*-1 would perform `` satisfactorily '' on the bench . 
In contrast , the lawyers ' association gives a `` well qualified '' rating to those `` regarded * as one of the best available for the vacancy .
Metallgesellschaft AG said 0 it agreed *-1 to acquire 51 % of Lentjes AG from the Ferdinand Lentjes Foundation . 
Terms were n't disclosed *-1 . 
Metallgesellschaft , a diversified Frankfurt , West Germany-based metals group , said 0 it is buying the stake in the specialized engineering company *-1 to expand its production of environmental supplies for power plants . 
Lentjes ' product mix of specialized boilers and pipes provides a good fit with its own Lurgi G.m.b . H. plant engineering unit , the company said 0 *T*-1 . 
The move is part of a strategy 0 *T*-3 to focus on its core metals trading , processing and plant engineering activities while *-1 shedding peripheral units , the company said 0 *T*-2 . 
Lentjes had 1988 sales of 800 million marks -LRB- $ 434.4 million *U* -RRB- and has a current order backlog of 2.5 billion marks . 
The sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of Lentjes stock . 
A plan * to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset *-1 by the recent weakness of Frankfurt share prices .
The U.S. International Trade Commission issued preliminary rulings under the U.S. anti-dumping act that imports of sweaters from Hong Kong , Taiwan and South Korea may be injuring a domestic industry . 
Because of the rulings , the Commerce Department will continue *-1 to investigate complaints *ICH*-2 by U.S. sweater makers that the imports are reaching the U.S. at unfairly low prices in violation of the U.S. anti-dumping act . 
The law defines unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter 's home market . 
ITC officials said 0 final Commerce Department and ITC rulings wo n't come until next March or later . 
If both agencies find violations of the U.S. trade law , the U.S. would assess penalty duties on the imports , which *T*-1 already are subject to import quotas under bilateral textile and apparel trade agreements . 
Imports of manmade-fiber sweaters in 1988 totaled about $ 405 million *U* from Taiwan , $ 400 million *U* from South Korea and $ 125 million *U* from Hong Kong , according to the ITC . 
In another action , the ITC dismissed anti-dumping act complaints filed * by Du Pont Co. of Wilmington , Del. , against imports of neoprene , a type of synthetic rubber , from France and West Germany . 
These imports totaled about $ 17 million *U* last year .
Upjohn Co. said 0 it will offer an early retirement package to as many as 1,100 employees in a cost-cutting move expected * to result in a fourth-quarter charge . 
Upjohn officials said 0 they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees , and how many , *T*-1 will participate in the retirement plan . 
But the pharmaceutical company said 0 it `` anticipates 0 the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's implementation will more than offset short-term costs . '' 
The program , available to Upjohn employees 55 years old or older , could increase an individual 's retirement benefits 10 % to 20 % *U* . 
In addition , Upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay . 
Chairman Theodore Cooper called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy 0 * to implement budget constraints and `` an effective headcount-control program *T*-1 . '' 
But some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have *T*-1 , because few jobs will end up *-2 being eliminated *-3 . 
`` It 's a cosmetic move , '' said *T*-1 Jonathan S. Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co . 
According to Upjohn 's estimates , only 50 % to 60 % *U* of the 1,100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan . 
Upjohn further estimated that about 50 % of the employees who *T*-2 leave for early retirement may be replaced *-1 . 
As a result , Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21,000 jobs world-wide . 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Upjohn shares rose 87.5 cents to $ 38.875 *U* apiece . 
An Upjohn spokesman said 0 he had `` heard nothing '' 0 *T*-3 to suggest 0 the early retirement package was spurred *-1 by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company , which *T*-2 occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation . 
The company earlier this year adopted a shareholder-rights plan *-1 to ward off unwanted suitors . 
The spokesman said 0 it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year cost-control strategy . 
Earlier staff-reduction moves have trimmed about 300 jobs , the spokesman said 0 *T*-1 .
INTER-TEL Inc . 
-LRB- Chandler , Ariz. -RRB- -- Jerry Chapman , managing director of WayMar Associates , was elected *-1 a director of this business telecommunications software and systems concern . 
He increases the board to seven .
`` Feeding Frenzy '' -LRB- Henry Holt , 326 pages , $ 19.95 *U* -RRB- , a highly detailed account of the Wedtech scandal , begins on a reassuring note . 
Right up front in the preface , co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity . 
When *-4 offered *-3 a free trip from the Bronx , Wedtech 's home , to Washington , D.C. , by one of Wedtech 's principals *T*-2 , he tells the reader , `` *-5 mindful of * accepting anything of value from those 0 I was writing about *T*-1 , I declined . '' 
Any question as to why an author would believe 0 this plaintive , high-minded note of assurance is necessary *T*-2 is answered *-1 by * reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers . 
Bribe by bribe , Mr. Sternberg and his co-author , Matthew C. Harrison Jr. , lead us along the path 0 Wedtech traveled *T*-1 , from its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor , entrusted * with the task of * producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy . 
The book revolves around John Mariotta , the founder of the company , and Fred Neuberger , who *T*-1 became his partner soon after Wedtech 's creation . 
Although *-1 started in 1965 , Wedtech did n't really get *-1 rolling until 1975 , when Mr. Neuberger discovered the federal government 's Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- minority business program *T*-2 . 
This is a Johnson-era , Great Society creation that *T*-2 mandates 0 certain government contracts be awarded *-1 noncompetitively to minority businesses . 
Mr. Neuberger realized that , although of Italian ancestry , Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born *-1 in Puerto Rico . 
The two partners merely had *-1 to falsify the true ownership of the corporation . 
Instead of 50\/50 it became , on paper only , two-thirds Mariotta , one-third Neuberger , and they were in the program and off to the races . 
Besides *-1 being a `` minority-owned company '' Wedtech was located *-1 in the South Bronx , a blighted area , made * famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign . 
The company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about * rebuilding the South Bronx and kept *-1 using the minority -- South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s . 
*-1 Starting with Congressman Mario Biaggi -LRB- now serving a jail sentence -RRB- , the company began a career of * bribing federal , state and local public officials and those close to public officials , right up to *RNR*-2 and including *RNR*-2 E. Robert Wallach , close friend and adviser to former Attorney General Ed Meese . 
Wedtech did n't just use old fashioned bribery . 
It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling , *-1 retaining politically connected `` respectable '' law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger . 
When necessary , it sought and received assistance from organized crime . 
Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company . 
Wedtech management used the merit system . 
If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity . 
If you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , a fate that *T*-1 eventually befell Mr. Mariotta , the firm 's semiliterate `` minority '' person . 
But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy-to-read tabloid writing style , `` Feeding Frenzy '' often falls short of gripping reading . 
None of the scams show much ingenuity : Auditors found crookery the first day on the job . 
Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up . 
The scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes , conspicuous consumers who *T*-1 wanted big houses , Mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes . 
Among the lot of them , not one is wrestling with good and evil , or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane . 
The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz , a pediatrician who *T*-1 changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack . 
He enters the story toward the end , just in time 0 * to get *-1 arrested *-1 *T*-2 . 
*-1 Absorbed in * doling out `` Feeding Frenzy 's '' tidbits , the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech , namely the Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place *T*-2 . 
They do at least come around to * saying that the courts might want *-1 to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . '' 
Programs like Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- are a little like * leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by *-2 to scoop it up *T*-1 . 
Numerous other scandals , among them the ones at HUD , have the same characteristics as Wedtech . 
They take place in government programs that *T*-1 seem tailor-made for corruption . 
Why are programs like this not eliminated *-2 *T*-1 ? `` Feeding Frenzy '' does provide a few clues . 
In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are *T*-3 groups of people who *T*-2 can best be described *-1 as *-4 belonging to a political insider commercial party . 
They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment *T*-2 , there is big money 0 *T*-3 to be made *-1 in * influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government . 
They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish * to see anything change . 
How many government programs and policies *T*-1 exist because they line the pockets of political insiders ? This is the real issue raised * by the Wedtech scandal . 
Mr. Stern was chairman and chief executive officer of the New York State Urban Development Corp. , 1983-85 .
The Finnish government and major creditors of bankrupt shipyard Waertsilae Marine Industries Oy agreed in principle *-1 to form a new company *-2 to complete most of the troubled shipyard 's backlog of 15 ships . 
The new company will attempt *-1 to limit the shipyard 's losses , participants said 0 *T*-2 . 
`` The situation is that the bankruptcy court will get out of the shipbuilding business . 
Everything will be taken over *-1 by the new company , '' said *T*-2 Christian Andersson , executive vice president of Oy Waertsilae , former parent of Waertsilae Marine . 
Once its ownership is finalized *-1 , the new company will open talks *ICH*-3 with state-appointed receivers 0 * to buy or lease Waertsilae Marine 's shipyard facilities *T*-2 . 
Subcontractors will be offered *-1 a settlement and a swift transition to new management is expected *-2 to avert an exodus of skilled workers from Waertsilae Marine 's two big shipyards , government officials said 0 *T*-3 . 
Under an accord signed * yesterday , the government and Union Bank of Finland would become major shareholders in the new company , each injecting 100 million Finnish markkaa -LRB- $ 23.5 million *U* -RRB- . 
Oy Waertsilae is *-1 to contribute 200 million markkaa , most of it as subordinated debt , and take a minority stake in the new company . 
Customers holding contracts for Waertsilae Marine 's undelivered ships are expected *-1 to subscribe most of the remaining 170 million markkaa in share capital , government officials said 0 *T*-2 . 
Waertsilae Marine 's biggest creditor is Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc . 
Carnival , which *T*-1 has three ships on order from Waertsilae Marine , presented claims for $ 1.5 billion *U* damages in the bankruptcy court this week . 
Waertsilae Marine 's bankruptcy proceedings began Tuesday in a Helsinki court .
Its plans * to be acquired *-1 dashed *-2 , Comprehensive Care Corp. said 0 it plans *-3 to sell most of its psychiatric and drug abuse facilities in California and some other assets *-3 to pay its debt and provide working capital . 
In all , the company hopes *-2 to repay $ 45 million *U* in debt through the sales , which *T*-1 will completely discharge its secured debt , the company said 0 *T*-3 . 
In addition , the company has replaced its president and chief executive , *-1 naming W. James Nichol , head of the company 's contract health services , to succeed B. Lee Karns . 
Mr. Nichol said 0 he was `` extremely disappointed in the continuing deterioration of the company 's operations while it attempted *-1 to conclude the reorganization during the past four months . '' 
Concurrent with Mr. Nichol 's appointment , Comprehensive Care moved its corporate headquarters from Irvine , Calif. , to St. Louis , where the company maintained its contract services offices *T*-1 . 
Mr. Karns continues as chairman . 
Comprehensive Care had agreed *-2 to be acquired *-1 by closely held First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk , Va. , but the sale sputtered almost from the beginning and finally collapsed last week . 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Comprehensive Care closed at $ 3.75 *U* a share , up 12.5 cents .
Ralston Purina Co. reported a 47 % decline in fourth-quarter earnings , * reflecting restructuring costs as well as a more difficult pet food market . 
The St. Louis company earned $ 45.2 million *U* , or 65 cents a share , compared with $ 84.9 million *U* , or $ 1.24 *U* a share , a year earlier . 
Sales in the latest period were $ 1.76 billion *U* , a 13 % increase from last year 's $ 1.55 billion *U* . 
For the year ended Sept. 30 , Ralston earned $ 422.5 million *U* , or $ 6.44 *U* a share , up 8.9 % from $ 387.8 million *U* , or $ 5.63 *U* a share . 
This year 's results included a gain of $ 70.2 million *U* on the disposal of seafood operations . 
Sales for the full year were $ 6.6 billion *U* , up 13 % from $ 5.8 billion *U* . 
Ralston said 0 its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville , N.C. , the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company . 
The battery plant , which *T*-2 makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products , will be closed *-1 over the next year or so , a spokesman said 0 *T*-3 . 
Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures , which *T*-1 required higher advertising spending . 
For the year , pet food volume was flat , the company said 0 *T*-1 . 
Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases , but also spent more on promotion . 
The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales , it added 0 *T*-1 . 
Ralston said 0 its Eveready battery unit was hurt *-1 by continuing economic problems in South America . 
Ralston shares closed yesterday at $ 80.50 *U* , off $ 1 *U* , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .
Companies listed * below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates . 
The companies are followed *-1 by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share . 
Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted *-1 . 
The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days *T*-1 . 
Otherwise , actual profit is compared *-1 with the 300-day estimate .
First Chicago Corp. said 0 it completed its $ 55.1 million *U* cash-and-stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp. , another Chicago bank holding company .
The record corn-buying binge by the Soviet Union is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S. grain pipeline . 
The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling *-1 to find enough river barges and trains 0 *T*-2 to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for * loading onto Soviet ships . 
River barge rates have soared 40 % this fall from a year earlier . 
Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business . 
And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge *-1 to find enough of the crop 0 *T*-2 to meet their obligations to the Soviets . 
The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn *ICH*-2 in October , which *T*-1 is the most ever sold * to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S. . 
The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered *-2 by January , which *T*-1 would be a strain in most years . 
But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River , on which flows *T*-1 much of the U.S. corn that *T*-3 is shipped *-2 overseas . 
`` We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record , '' said *T*-1 William Dunton , a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert . 
`` It is going *-1 to be real tight . 
'' Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains , the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges 0 their tows push *T*-1 at one time . 
In a few weeks , many barges probably wo n't be able *-2 to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning *-3 to reduce the flow of the Missouri River , which *T*-1 feeds into the Mississippi River . 
The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that *T*-1 feed it . 
Barge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain *ICH*-3 this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation . 
But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue *-1 falling this month . 
At St. Louis , the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed *-1 *T*-2 , an Army Corps spokesman said 0 *T*-3 . 
Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years . 
So far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade . 
Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded * there *-1 to calculate the price 0 they offer *T*-2 *-3 to buy corn from farmers . 
At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel *-1 to settle at $ 2.375 *U* a bushel . 
Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted * by the 1988 drought . 
With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try *-1 to gather the corn 0 they are obligated *-3 to deliver *T*-2 . 
Farmers are in the best position of many years 0 * to push up corn prices *T*-1 . 
Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise . 
In parts of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 *U* a bushel for corn . 
Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel , said 0 *T*-1 Lyle Reed , president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo , Iowa . 
It *EXP*-1 is n't clear , however , who *T*-2 would win a waiting game . 
Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins . 
Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin *-1 buying corn futures contracts -- *-2 only to see little appreciation . 
`` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain 0 *T*-3 to be shipped *-1 *T*-2 , '' said *T*-4 Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director . 
Although much of this country 's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge , it *EXP*-1 is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by *-2 shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port . 
Ports in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans . 
One railroad , for example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore . 
And it *EXP*-2 is n't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace . 
The Soviet orders were compressed *-1 into the month of October because of delays . 
The Soviet Union usually begins *-1 buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall . 
But its purchases apparently were delayed *-1 by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems . 
In other commodity markets yesterday : ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil . 
Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged *-1 in a fire , * tightening an already tight European market . 
Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon , up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange . 
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $ 19.94 *U* a barrel . 
Gasoline futures continued a sell-off that *T*-1 began Monday . 
PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets . 
December delivery gold fell $ 3.20 *U* an ounce to $ 377.60 *U* . 
December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.2180 *U* . 
January platinum was down $ 5.70 *U* an ounce at $ 494.50 *U* . 
Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced *-1 more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to William O'Neill , vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York . 
`` The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , '' he said *T*-1 .

Two leading constitutional-law experts said 0 President Bush does n't have the legal authority * to exercise a line-item veto . 
Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School said 0 any effort by President Bush 0 * to claim authority for a line-item veto *T*-1 would contradict the text of the Constitution and the intent of its authors , as well as the views of previous presidents . 
A line-item veto is a procedure that *T*-1 would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without *-2 having *-3 to scuttle the entire measure . 
Mr. Bush has said 0 he would like *-1 to be able *-2 to use this procedure . 
A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering *-1 declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto *-2 to provoke a test case . 
But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority * to exercise a line-item veto . '' 
The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal . 
The two professors said 0 the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures . 
Moreover , they said 0 the first appropriations bill passed * 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto . 
They also said that more than a dozen presidents *PPA*-1 have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president . 
Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation 0 * to give the president line-item veto power *T*-2 , but that it *EXP*-1 would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .
